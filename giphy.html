// 1. Before you can make any part of our site work, you need to create an array of strings, 
// each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called `topics`.
//    * We chose animals for our theme, but you can make a list to your own liking.
    var topics = {array of strings};

// 2. Your app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.
//    * Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.
    for(var i=0; i < topics.length; i++) {

// 3. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
    $(document).on("click", 

// 4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

// 5. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
//    * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
//    * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.

// 6. Add a form to your page that takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your `topics` array. 
// Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
//     var topics = {array of strings}
